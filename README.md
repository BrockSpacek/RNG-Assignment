Description: Created a pirate random name generator using JavaScript. Using a button click, I made a list of names and contact info and only kept the previous 5 on the screen.

Looks good Brock! I'm glad to be apart of your pirate crew! I like your background picture and your code works great! The picture though seems to move when I click on the button, but I'm not sure why. Besides that, great work!
